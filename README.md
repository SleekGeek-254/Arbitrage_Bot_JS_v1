# Arbitrage_Bot_JS_v1
* Still in `Development.`
This bot monitors the Uniswap DEX for arbitrage opportunities and executes trades on the DEX when it identifies an opportunity. It uses the Uniswap API to fetch data about token prices and pairs, and the `FlashLoanArbitrage` contract to execute trades.

## Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
- [Uniswap SDK](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/sdk/)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/arbitrage-bot.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Connect to an Ethereum or Polygon node:
   - Edit the `web3` instance in `index.js` to connect to your preferred node: `const web3 = new Web3('https://mainnet.infura.io');`
4. Load the `FlashLoanArbitrage` contract's ABI and address:
   - Replace the `abi` constant in `index.js` with the contract's ABI: `const abi = [{...}];`
   - Replace the contract instance in `index.js` with the contract's address: `const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, '0x1234567890abcdef');`
5. Set the address of the account that will call the contract's functions:
   - Replace the `from` parameter in the `send` function calls in `index.js` with the address of the account: `.send({ from: '0x1234567890abcdef' })`

## Running the Bot

To start the bot, run the following command:

``` npm start

The bot will run continuously and automatically execute trades when it identifies an arbitrage opportunity.

## Customization

You can customize the bot's behavior by modifying the `findArbitrageOpportunities` function in `index.js`. This function is called periodically to check for arbitrage opportunities, and you can implement your own strategies for identifying opportunities using the data provided by the Uniswap API.

## Disclaimer

This bot is provided as an example and is not intended to be used in production. Use at your own risk.

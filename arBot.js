//Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the function:
/* 
// 1.The function calls the uniswap.fetchTokenPrices method, which fetches the current prices of the 
specified token on different DEXs or blockchain platforms. In this case, the function is fetching the 
prices of the DAI token.

// 2.The uniswap.fetchTokenPrices method returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the 
prices of the token on each DEX. The object has keys for each DEX, and values for the token's price 
on that DEX.

// 3.The function checks if the price of DAI on Uniswap is higher than the price on another DEX (in 
this case, the DEX is referred to as "otherDEX"). If this is the case, it indicates that there may be
 an arbitrage opportunity on Uniswap.

// 4.The function calls the allowanceUSDC method of the FlashLoanArbitrage contract to check if the 
contract has enough USDC to execute the trade.

// 5.If the contract has enough USDC, the function calls the approveUSDC method of the FlashLoanArbitrage
 contract to allow the contract to spend the USDC.

// 6.After the approveUSDC function has been called, the contract is now allowed to spend the USDC. 
The function then calls the depositUSDC, buyDAI, depositDAI, and sellDAI methods of the FlashLoanArbitrage
 contract to execute the trade.

// 7.The function also calls the uniswap.fetchPairs method, which fetches a list of token pairs 
that are traded on Uniswap. The function can use this data to compare the prices of different pairs and
 identify arbitrage opportunities.
